AnagramDictionary: This implementation uses a HashMap to efficiently store and
retrieve anagrams based on their sorted form. The buildAnagramMap method is called during
the initialization of the dictionary to populate the HashMap. The getAnagramsOf method then
uses the sorted form of the input string to retrieve the corresponding list of anagrams from the HashMap.
