This console-based program prompts users to give stings in the form of English letters so that the constituent letters can comprise a Scrabble rack stored in a Rack object. 
Then this program creates a list of all legal words that can be found from the letters on that rack, where the legal words are defined by a dictionary optionally input from the command-line argument. 
If the specific dictionary is not prescribed by users, this program will automatically use the default Scrabble dictionary called "SOWPODS" for reference. 
The dictionary will be preprocessed by constructing a AnagramDictionary object to group anagrams into different sets for later use.
The output list of legal words is sorted in decreasing order by Scrabble scores which can be computed by a static method defined in the ScoreTable class.
