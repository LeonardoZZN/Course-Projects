This program runs the BookshelfKeeperProg class to allow clients to create a Bookshelf object with
any number of books of positive heights and maintain the books in a non-decreasing order of heights
through the BookshelfKeeper class. It also allows clients to pick a book from the bookshelf or put a 
book onto the shelf while maintaining its correct order of heights to avoid books falling down.
